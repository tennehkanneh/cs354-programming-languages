(a) What would be the symptom(s) of executing these command lines in
the wrong order?
        If the the commands were excuted in the wrong oder there could be compilation errors. 
        In C header files need to be compled before source files. There could be missing or out
        dated files resulting in linking issues because the inccorect libraries are being accessed.


(b) How does Make determine the order in which these tool executions
should occur?

        A Make file will determines what needs to happen first based on the targets, dependencies, and 
        rules of compiling. The make file to get to a target makes sure that the dependencis are up-to-date first
        after the dependencies it goes through is normal complyling.
        


(c) How could Makeâ€™s algorithm be undermined, thereby causing those
symptom(s)?

        Errors and inconcistentice can undermne the Make file.
